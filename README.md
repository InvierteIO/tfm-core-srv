# TFM Core Service

This is the core backend service for the InvierteIO platform. It is built with Java 21, Spring Boot, and Maven, and provides RESTful APIs for project and subproject management, file uploads (local and AWS S3), and more.

## Features

- Project and subproject management (CRUD)
- File upload support (local and AWS S3)
- Domain-driven design with JPA entities and domain models
- Reactive programming with Project Reactor
- Unit, integration, and mutation testing
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, CodeQL, PIT, and SonarCloud

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker (for containerization)
- AWS credentials (for S3 and ECS integration in production)

## Getting Started

### Local Development

aws.s3.bucket-name=your-bucket
aws.s3.region=us-east-1
```

### Docker

Build and run the Docker image:
```sh
docker build -t tfm-core-srv .
docker run -d --name tfm-core-srv-app -p 8081:8081 tfm-core-srv
```

## Testing

Run all tests (unit, integration, mutation):
```sh
mvn verify
```

## CI/CD
